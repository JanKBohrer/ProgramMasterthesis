x = radius in mm
y = g(ln r) in g/m^3


Dear Simon,

Sorry for my slow reply. It has been a while since we published the 2007
JCP paper. After some searching, I found the BIMGQ code and regenerated
the data for you - I think. Please see the attached files, the name
should indicate which one is which. For example,
GQ_10_Long_s16.dat means the data for Long kernel at t = 10 minutes

Figures 9 and 10 used column 1 (x) and column 5 (y).

Please let me know if you have any question.

    Dear Lian-Ping

    I read your 2007 JCP paper on solving the kinetic collection
    equation with great interest.
    I am using a particle-based microphysical model, where I want to
    assess the numerical behaviour of the implemented collision algorithm.
    I would like to compare it with your results.
    Could you be so kind and send me your data shown in your Fig. 9 and
    10 such that I could add your solution to my plots.
    The data given in Tables 3 and 4 are also useful for comparison.
    Thanks for listing them in the paper. Those I can read off.

    Thank you in advance.
    Simon
